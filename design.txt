Pac-Man Design Document
1. Game Overview
Genre: Maze chase arcade game
Platform: PC
Target Audience: Casual gamers, retro game enthusiasts, and arcade fans.
Core Concept: Guide a character through a maze, eating pellets and avoiding enemies, with power-ups that temporarily turn the tables on adversaries.
2. Game Concept and Objectives
Primary Objective: Clear each maze by consuming all pellets while avoiding contact with roaming ghosts.
Secondary Objectives:
Collect bonus items (e.g., fruits) for extra points.
Use power-ups (power pellets) to turn ghosts vulnerable and earn bonus points by consuming them.
Unique Selling Points:
Simple, intuitive controls.
Increasing difficulty with each level.
Iconic characters and recognizable art style that pay homage to the classic arcade era.
3. Gameplay Mechanics
3.1 Player Movement and Controls
Movement: Pac-Man moves in four cardinal directions (up, down, left, right) using arrow keys
Grid-Based Navigation: The maze is segmented into a grid, ensuring precise movement and collision detection.
Responsiveness: Immediate feedback on input with smooth transitions between grid cells.
3.2 Maze and Pellet System
Maze Layout:
Fixed, labyrinth-style maze with predetermined pathways.
Special tunnels on the sides enable wrap-around movement.
Pellets:
Small dots scattered throughout the maze.
Collecting all pellets clears the level.
Bonus Items:
Fruits or other themed icons appear intermittently to grant bonus points when collected.
3.3 Ghosts and AI Behavior
Characters: Four ghosts, each with distinct colors and personalities:
Blinky (Red): Chases Pac-Man directly.
Pinky (Pink): Attempts to position ahead of Pac-Man.
Inky (Blue): Uses a more unpredictable, ambivalent strategy.
Clyde (Orange): Alternates between chasing and fleeing.
When a power pellet is consumed, ghosts switch to a vulnerable state, indicated by a color change and slower movement.
Collision Dynamics:
Contact with a ghost in normal mode results in a life loss.
Contact during the vulnerable state allows Pac-Man to "eat" the ghost for bonus points.
3.4 Scoring and Level Progression
Scoring:
Points awarded for every pellet and bonus item collected.
Higher bonus points for consuming ghosts during their vulnerable state.
Level Progression:
Difficulty increases with each level (e.g., faster ghost speeds, slight modifications to maze layout).
Progressive challenges to keep players engaged as they advance.
4. Art and Audio Direction
4.1 Visual Style
Art Style:
Minimalist and colorful, employing retro pixel art or simple vector graphics.
Clear, distinctive character designs that evoke the original arcade aesthetics.
Animations:
Smooth, looping animations for Pac-Manâ€™s chomping motion.
Simple yet expressive animations for ghosts, especially when transitioning to a vulnerable state.
4.2 Audio
Sound Effects:
Iconic arcade sound effects for pellet consumption, ghost interactions, and power-up activations.
Background Music:
A looping, upbeat track with a retro feel that heightens the arcade atmosphere.
Audio Cues:
Distinct audio signals for life loss, level completion, and bonus item collection to provide clear feedback.
5. Technical Specifications
5.1 Engine and Tools
Input Handling:
Support for keyboard.
Rendering:
Efficient 2D sprite rendering with smooth animation cycles and minimal latency.
5.2 Collision Detection and Physics
Collision System:
Grid-based collision detection for accurate pellet collection and ghost encounters.
Physics:
Simple movement physics with no complex simulation required; focus is on timing and precise input.
6. User Interface (UI) and HUD
HUD Elements:
Score Display: Constantly visible at the top or side of the screen.
Lives Counter: Visual representation of remaining lives.
Level Indicator: Current level information.
Menus:
Main menu for starting the game, viewing high scores, and accessing options.
Pause menu with resume, restart, and quit options.
Game over screen with final score and high score submission.
7. Level Design
7.1 Maze Structure
Fixed Layout:
Consistent pellet and wall placement designed for balanced gameplay.
Variations:
Slight changes in maze structure for advanced levels to increase difficulty.
Introduction of obstacles or alternative routes in later levels.
7.2 Difficulty Scaling
Ghost Speed and Behavior:
Incrementally increase ghost speed with each new level.
8. Game Flow and State Management
8.1 Core Game States
Startup: Splash screen followed by the main menu.
Gameplay: Main loop where the player navigates the maze.
Pause: Ability to pause and resume the game.
Game Over: Triggered by losing all lives, with options to restart or return to the main menu.
Level Transition: Brief interstitial screens between levels with score and performance summary.
8.2 Event Handling
Timed Events:
Power pellet effects (duration of ghost vulnerability).
Ghost behavior switching after a set period.
Input Events:
Continuous polling for responsive player controls.
State Transitions:
Clear, logical transitions between game states to ensure smooth gameplay.
